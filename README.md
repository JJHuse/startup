## The pitch

Toward the end of 2020, I joked with my family about a New Year's resolution: eat a quesadilla every day. I got some positive responses, so I started thinking more about it. I thought "Oh what the heck." So I did it. A _different_ quesadilla every day. I'd document it on Instagram too. Boy was that the right decision--I was accountable. So if it was the end of a busy day, 10 pm, and I still hadn't had a quesadilla, I did it anyway. Traveling? I made sure to have the ingredients wherever I was. Unfortunately, Instagram isn't built for this, so I haven't gone back to do anything quite like it. What would the world be if there were a social media platform built for this? People would dream, and the dreams would come true.
