## The pitch

Toward the end of 2020, I joked with my family about a New Year's resolution: eat a quesadilla every day. I got some positive responses, so I started thinking more about it. I thought "Oh what the heck." So I did it. A _different_ quesadilla every day. I owe the success largely to friends on Instagram for keeping me accountable. Unfortunately, Instagram isn't built for this, so I haven't gone back to do anything quite like it. I'm imagining a social media platform built for this. Built for dreamers to put the dreaming spark out there, and built for dreamers to have a committed support network. What would the world be like? People would dream, and the dreams would come true.
