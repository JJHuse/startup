## Notes go here
I ðŸ«€ this  
also now I know how to resolve merge conflicts

SSH
- I now have a BYU and home IP with SSH access.

Domain name
- Those were some really long terms and conditions.
- I added the public IP and wildcard records.

CSS
- Rule: selector {property:value; another declaration;}

### Deployment
#### HTML
- deployFiles.sh works as is for both the startup and Simon&reg;
- This isn't too bad :)
#### CSS
Todo:

- Color theme (Buttons, footer banner)
- Font consistency
- Alignment
- Media queries
